# Transcription

Transcription should generally aim to reproduce the page as written, with the following concessions:

Consistent orthographic mergers (such as व and ब) may be noted in the document header (see below) and transcribed as the individually-intended characters for ease of reading.
Spaces should be placed where possible between words (but not compounds).
Lines ending in the middle of a word should affix a hyphen (-) at the end and optionally a hyphen at the beginning of the next line.

Transliteration scheme

Transcription should follow the IAST transliteration scheme with several extensions for vowels and punctuation as noted below.

*  अ before इ or उ: ä or a
*  abbreviation marks: ॰ . 
*  dot/period: • 
*  daṇḍa:।
*  double daṇḍa: ॥
*  line-ending mark: \ or ¦
*  notable virāma/hiatus
